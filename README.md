**Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Posts About Group Emotion Change Pattern**

This is an academic project done in the middle of May, 2011.

The interest of this project is in how Hopkins studentâ€™s emotion changes in the first day before the final exam week,
and to determine how latest news and incidence affect the emotion change.

- [**robot.pl**](https://github.com/sukekiyo/sentimental-tweets-map/blob/master/robot.pl) a crawler, got tweets from search.twitter.com and label them with a time stamp representing when they are tweeted.

- [**TrainingData.pl**](https://github.com/sukekiyo/sentimental-tweets-map/blob/master/TrainingData.pl) a crawler, got tweets from search.twitter.com with labels indicating their attitudes (positive/negative), as our original training data.

- [**analysis.pl**](https://github.com/sukekiyo/sentimental-tweets-map/blob/master/analysis.pl) Added weights to words according to the frequency to get two emotion 'score' (positive/negative) for any given time, then group the score by hour.

- [**Report**](https://github.com/sukekiyo/sentimental-tweets-map/blob/master/Final%20Project%20Report_Xi%20Wang%2C%20Yining%20Wang.pdf) contains implementation details and all the outcomes charts.

Now I am trying to reuse the code for another project since I found the sentiment analysis still an interesting topic to me. So this project probably will transform to something cooler soon. I just don't know yet. :P
